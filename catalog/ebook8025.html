    <p>Have you ever wondered if there is some kind of secret formula for getting a man to see YOU as the one woman he can’t live without?</p>
    <p>Or for finally understanding what’s going on in his mind – and what he's REALLY thinking about you and your relationship?</p>
    <p>Some people might tell you that there’s no secret – that every man is different. But the truth is that there are certain
			<span class="underscore">universal truths</span> that explain why a man will pick another woman over you.</p>
    <p>Or why you can do everything “right” with a man, yet he still doesn’t see that you’re a catch. Or why a man will come on
			strong, tell you that you’re the most amazing woman he’s ever met, and then completely disappear from your life.</p>
    <p>Why did he do that? Was it him? Was it something you did? What if you could go back and change something – would things have turned out
			differently?</p>
    <p>Look, I’m going to be honest with you. As a man, I’ve done all those things that have driven you crazy. I can also tell you –
			honestly – why I did those things and what makes a man stick around for the long term.</p>
    <p>If you’re looking for the <strong>raw truth about what makes a man go crazy for you</strong> and commit to you alone, then you need my eBook. Stop
			driving yourself crazy and spending hours analyzing men with your girlfriends. I’ll teach you how to stop coming across as “needy”
			and instead be the woman he craves.</p>
