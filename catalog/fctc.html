<div class="section"><div class="container"><p class="strong">Dear Friend Who Would Like To Learn How To Make Men Commit,</p><p>Has something like this ever happened to you?</p><p>You meet a guy who seems to have something “special” about him.</p><p>And I’m not talking about just another guy here… I’m talking about a guy who is <strong>relationship material</strong>.</p><p>The better you get to know him, the more you begin to really feel the connection… and it seems like he feels it too. And when you
			finally do get together, it feels like magic is in the air…</p><p>You intuitively know you both feel a unique connection that could lead to something really special.</p><p>Life is wonderful… and although you know it’s a little soon, you start to feel like this actually could be “it.”</p><p>There’s fun, passion, romance. Amazing conversations, laughs, inside jokes…</p><p>It all feels so right that it wouldn’t surprise you if you two could spend the rest of your love lives together and stay deeply
			connected and in love.</p><p>While you know it’s a little soon to start thinking that way, you make up your mind that you’re definitely ready for a
			committed relationship with him. You want him and no one else. And you’d like him to only be with you.</p><p>But the reality is that you don’t know how to tell him the way you’re feeling, or to find out if he really feels the same
			way.</p><p>Although, after all the things he’s said and done with you, and all the time you’ve spent together, you’re pretty sure
			he feels the same about you.</p><p>You decide to “play it cool” and see where this leads.</p><p>But as the days pass, you find yourself hoping he will say something to you… picturing the moment when he will finally open up, share
			his deeper feelings, and ask you to be “his”…</p><p>But before you know it, weeks or months have gone by, <em>and nothing!</em></p>

		<p>You find your head filling with unanswered questions:</p><p>“Where are we going with this?”</p><p>“Does he feel it too?”</p><p>“Is he seeing other people?”</p><p>You’ve been patient, but it’s driving you nuts… <em>you have to know.</em></p><p>You decide to bring it up, in the most casual way possible.</p><p>But when you do, he just doesn’t seem to “get it.”</p><p>Maybe he says a few shallow things like, “What do you mean? We’ve only been dating for a few months!” or…
			“Everything is great the way it is now!”</p><p>Or worse yet, he completely avoids the conversation, won’t open up, and acts like you are the one being difficult.</p><p>Then, over the next few days, he becomes more and more distant. Things definitely aren’t the same.</p><p>The phone calls aren’t as frequent. Communication seems forced and awkward.</p><p>And eventually, it stops completely and the unthinkable happens: He’s gone. One minute he seemed to be Mr. Right, and the next
			he’s gone. And all you have to show for it is a cold, empty feeling in the pit of your stomach.</p><p>It really sucks to have already committed your heart, your time, your energy, and your love for the sake of the relationship, and then
			find out that he’s not even willing to go there with you.</p><p>So what’s going on here?</p><p>Why is it that guys seem to be able to date forever and not even care about experiencing the deep connection and intense feelings of love
			and intimacy that a committed relationship can bring?</p><h2>Why A Guy Will Want To “Pull Away” From You When It Comes Time For Him To Commit… And What To Do 	About It</h2><p>If you are like most women, you’ve asked yourself this question time and time again.</p><p>And unfortunately, most women go about trying to remedy this situation in 1 of 3 disastrous ways:</p><h3>1. Trying To Convince Him</h3><p>Just like a pushy salesman trying to get you to buy a car, trying to convince a man that he should be in a relationship with you actually
			makes him want it LESS.</p><p>Why? Because <strong>convincing feels unnatural</strong>. He realizes that if a relationship with you was what he really wanted
			there’d be no convincing necessary. He’d FEEL IT emotionally, and his feelings would tell him all he needs to know.</p><h3>2. Trading</h3><p>If you start withholding yourself from a man when you don’t get the love and connection you want, or you only “give when you
			get,” you’re trading. Doing this keeps you from the very thing you want, creating resentment and distrust inside a
			man’s mind.</p><p>You can’t “win” the trading game. Rather than helping a man and a woman closer, it creates mistrust and distance.</p><h3>3. Giving Him An Ultimatum</h3><p>While giving your man an ultimatum will definitely get you an answer, when you put a guy on the spot like this, it usually
			<strong>won’t be the answer you want</strong>.</p><p>Pressure does not change people’s feelings. Especially when it comes to a man’s often stubborn and unexplored emotions.</p><p>In fact, often times he doesn’t even know exactly what he’s feeling, because he hasn’t spent much, or any, time analyzing
			everything on an emotional level.</p><p class="strong">These three strategies only succeed in pushing a man further away.</p><p>In the rare case that one does work, the bottom line is that it’s an unnatural and forced way to get what you want.</p><p>It will bring you a short-lived result… at best.</p><div class="module span-container pad-left unveil" data-src="https://cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/static/images/banners/w_853_h_550_banner-fctc-couplebedsnuggle.jpg" style="background-image:url('../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/global/static/images/1x1.gif');"><div class="content"><h2>The Only True Way To Keep Moving Deeper & Deeper Into A Committed Relationship So It Lasts</h2><p>Getting a guy to want to be more and more committed with you can be summed up in 2 simple steps…</p><p>1. Create in a man the feeling that he’s <strong>better off being with you than being single, spending most of his
					time with his friends, or “sleeping around.”</strong></p><p>AND…</p><p>2. Show a man, on a physical and emotional level, <strong>that he’s better off being with you than any other
					woman he could possibly meet.</strong></p></div></div><p>Deep down, being <em>truly loved</em> is what all men want.</p><p>But when I say deep down, I mean it.</p><p>In fact, for men, the desire for love and intimate connection is often <em>buried</em> under other layers of wiring–such as the desire
			to do things like provide or reproduce.</p><p>With the strong impulses of this other level of wiring, it’s easy for a man to forget about his love wiring. In fact, sometimes men
			will even think and behave in <strong>ways that are in direct conflict with their impulses to find real love and deep
			connection.</strong></p><p>In order for him to feel that he is better off being with you than being single and sleeping with lots of women… or
			focusing obsessively on his career until he has enough money to support a family… you need to remind him
			of the benefits that a connected, loving relationship brings… and unlock those hidden feelings inside of him.</p><p>Now, this isn’t something you can do just by talking about it. The key is to actually get him to EXPERIENCE those feelings when
			he’s around you.</p><p>Fortunately it’s easy to do–especially when he’s already attracted to you. There are exact steps you can take to turn those
			feelings of attraction into feelings of intimacy, passion, and long term connection.</p><p>And here’s the best part:</p><p>Few women know how to help a man get in touch with this emotional part of himself, and because of your ability to help him do so, he’ll
			quickly start experiencing a deep connection with you that he’ll want to keep it alive and growing.</p><p>It’s like you’ve flipped a secret trigger in his heart, and he’ll want to be with you night and day… and no one else.</p><p>In fact, a guy will not willfully commit to you unless you flip this “switch.” And no amount of pleading, begging,
			withholding, etc. will work.</p><h2>How To Take Your Relationship From Casual To Committed In A Way That He’ll Be THRILLED With Becoming Closer To You, Instead Of Wanting
			To Withdraw</h2><p>My program, <em class="strong">From Casual to Committed</em>, will teach you how to flip this switch in your man without experiencing
			the resistance, frustrations, and ups-and-downs that get in the way of building a connection and all too often bring relationships
			to a <em>screeching halt</em>.</p><p>It’s a roadmap of steps you need to take to avoid the common roadblocks men create in moving past the casual dating stage, as well
			as how to smoothly arrive to a committed situation that you both cherish and want to grow together.</p><p>Here are just a few of the other powerful secrets you’ll learn inside:</p><ul class="bullet"><li>The specific, <strong>step-by-step process</strong> to move your relationship from casual to committed, naturally
				and effortlessly… without experiencing that typical male resistance</li><li>How to get your man to come up with his own reasons to commit to you so he asks you to get serious first</li><li>How to <strong>initiate “the talk”</strong> with a man in a way that he’ll be excited about getting
				closer to you</li><li>A big mistake women make that makes a man feel smothered in the relationship and actually makes him miss being single
				(This mistake is one of the biggest causes of breakups, and it’s important that you know what it is)</li><li>The only surefire way to know with 100% accuracy whether or not a guy is into you for the long term, or if you are
				<strong>wasting your time</strong></li><li>Why a relationship is a naturally challenging thing to a man, and how to help your man deal with and get through his own
				internal conflicts (A little secret: Men want to work through these things but usually don’t know how… so when
				you are the one to help him do it <strong>he will feel closer to you than he ever has with a woman before</strong>)</li><li>A way to communicate that you are the perfect woman for him (Most importantly… doing this can make a man feel that you are
				his best possible choice… and the only woman he should be with)</li><li>How to tell if your relationship is where it should be (Many women make the mistake of thinking things are moving too slow with
				a man when in reality they are going just fine. Here’s exactly how to know when you can relax… and when you need
				to make something happen)</li><li>How to figure out exactly <strong>where your man is in the commitment process</strong>–what’s on his mind–how he feels,
				and exactly what you need to do next for him to be yours</li></ul><p>By the time you finish going through this program, you’ll also gain these 7 important insights:</p><ol><li>A clear understanding of what the commitment process is, and how it works for a man</li><li>An understanding of a man’s subconscious resistance to commitment… why all men experience it… and how you can
				make him want to let his guard down with you</li><li>How to have a loving relationship without “work” or unnecessary stress</li><li>How to experience deeper levels of connection inside of your relationship… and connect with your man in a way that no
				woman ever has before</li><li>How to transition into a relationship faster and skip meaningless “dating” and “hanging out”</li><li>How to always know exactly where you and your man are “at” in a relationship without ever having to ask him</li><li>How to make a faster transition from a committed relationship to a life-long commitment of marriage (if that’s what
				you’re looking for)</li></ol><p>I want you to experience the life-long love that you’ve been dreaming about, and this program will show you EXACTLY how to do it.</p><div class="banner span-window

		<p>The program not only walks you through the psychological, emotional, and behavioral foundations of how commitment really works, but it
			also uses every day, real-world examples… including specific strategies for communication and getting a man to “open
			up” that will dramatically impact both the quality of the relationship you are in now as well as all your relationships.</p><p>Every one of us dreams of one day experiencing that “storybook” romance with that special person we are <em>meant</em> to
			share our lives with…</p><p>We think about how wonderful it will feel to finally be with that person… look into their eyes… and KNOW that we’ve
			found the love and connection we’ve been searching for.</p><p>But one thing it’s taken me a long time to realize is that there is no “peak point” or “pinnacle” in
			love…</p><p>I’ve realized that love is an exciting journey we share with someone special… and that the journey of love is the pinnacle
			of LIFE.</p><p>This journey will always have a beginning… which starts when you meet that special someone you are meant to share your life
			with… but it doesn’t always have to have an end.</p><p>The key to keeping it alive is getting through the inevitable obstacles all couples face as they become closer and more connected with
			one another… and turning them into learning experiences which bring you closer together instead of pushing you apart.</p><p>I’ve designed this program to help guide you along your path… and ensure that the journey you share with your soul mate is
			one of never-ending love and happiness.</p><p>It’s up to you to make sure you have the knowledge and skills you need on your journey. So what are you waiting for? Try out
			<em class="strong">From Casual to Committed</em> right away.</p>
		<p>Your friend in life and love,</p>
