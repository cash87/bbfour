		<p>In fact, that list of questions was created from talking to literally <strong>hundreds</strong> of women about the problems they were
			facing in their love lives.</p><p>It’s a fact: relationships with men so often start off “hot and heavy,” but then quickly and unexpectedly turn ice-cold.</p><p>Nearly all women have had the experience of feeling like they’ve finally found something “real” with a man, and sharing
			themselves both emotionally AND physically, only to have him suddenly <strong>pull away</strong>.</p><p>And what’s worse, when this happens, there often seems to be no explanation, and NO GOOD REASON AT ALL.</p><p>But the truth is there <span class="underscore">is</span> a reason. And I’m here to tell you why. Because, while it’s difficult
			to have a person reject our feelings…</p><p>It’s even worse NOT KNOWING <span class="underscore">WHY</span>.</p><div class="module span-container pad-left unveil" data-src="https://cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/static/images/banners/w_853_h_550_banner-nala-couplemotorcycle.jpg" style="background-image:url('../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/global/static/images/1x1.gif');"><div class="content"><h2>Why Men Pull Away From Some Women… But Fall Head Over Heels For Others</h2><p>Men in these situations are rarely any help. They will usually try to explain themselves by saying dumb things
					like “It’s not you, it’s me.”</p><p>Or another predictable male excuse such as, “I’m just not ready for a serious relationship.”</p><p>I know this very well, because I’ve been “that guy” in the past…</p></div></div><p>I’ve been the guy who withdraws. The kind who spontaneously gets “scared” when a relationship gets close and intimate, and
			the kind of guy that can make a close, loving, lasting relationship seem IMPOSSIBLE.</p><p>Most men have <span class="underscore">never</span> pulled away from a woman because they weren’t “ready for a
			relationship…” or because they “got nervous” or “wanted to take things slow.”</p><p>I’ll admit it. I know all about “that guy”… because that guy has been ME. But let me let you
			in on a couple of secrets, the first of which you MIGHT already know:</p><ol class="strong"><li>The “excuses” I mentioned above, and ALL of the rest of the common “man excuses”… are
				A BUNCH OF B.S.</li><li>Deep down, 99% of all men ARE ready for a relationship… and would LOVE to find that special
				woman… someone with whom they could finally let their guard down, and experience true love</li></ol><p>Trust me on this one. I’ve known more than a few players. While some men will date several women at once, it’s
			<span class="underscore">only</span> because they <strong>haven’t met THE ONE they are really looking for.</strong></p><p>In fact, over the years I’ve seen every one of these guys bring their playing to a screeching halt when they met someone they were
			REALLY into. I’m sure you’ve seen this happen with guys you know.</p><p>I’m also embarrassed to admit it, but I’ve actually SAID both of the “excuses” I mentioned above on MORE than
			one occasion. After the perspective I’ve gained from years of understanding myself and other men, I finally realized that
			<strong>I <span class="underscore">never</span> actually meant it when I said it</strong>… and neither do other men.</p><p>The reality is that most men have <span class="underscore">never</span> pulled away from a woman because they weren’t “ready
			for a relationship ”… or because they “got nervous” or “wanted to take things slow”…
			although that’s all we could see to understand about ourselves and communicate at the time.</p><div class="module span-container pad-left unveil" data-src="https://cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/static/images/banners/w_853_h_550_banner-nala-couplerain.jpg" style="background-image:url('../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/global/static/images/1x1.gif');"><div class="content"><h2>The Secret Reason A Man Will Never Tell About Why He Didn’t Want You</h2><p>So many women can attest to the unfortunate experience of having a man pull away because he “wasn’t ready
					for something serious,” only to jump into a serious relationship with ANOTHER WOMAN just a few weeks later.</p><p>So why do men pull away from certain women… but fall HEAD OVER HEELS for others?</p></div></div><p>Well, I’m afraid that what I’m about to tell you may upset you, it’s actually good news.</p><p>When a man pulls away from a woman, it is not because men are “screwed up.”</p><p>And it’s not because he has doubts about being in a relationship.</p><p>It’s because he has doubts about being in a serious relationship with THAT PARTICULAR WOMAN.</p><p>Something is missing with that woman that makes him think that she is not the one for him to settle down with, and that <strong>he can
			do better</strong>.</p><div class="module color-block span-container headline center light-crush"><h3>It’s actually quite simple to give a man that powerful <strong>“gut feeling”</strong> that tells him
				you are <strong>“the one.”</strong></h3></div><p>Here’s something else you should know…</p><p>When this happens, it’s usually never over a “little thing.”</p><p>It’s also almost never because a man isn’t attracted to you physically (if that was the case, he wouldn’t have gotten
			that close to you in the first place).</p><p>It also doesn’t necessarily mean that he wasn’t at least somewhat attracted to you emotionally…</p><p>What it does mean is that <strong>there wasn’t enough attraction there to lead him to feel that YOU were the one</strong> for him.</p><p>So was there anything you could have done about it?</p><p>The answer is YES.</p><h2>How To Inspire That “Forever Feeling”… So He Knows That YOU Are The Perfect Woman For Him</h2><p>It’s actually quite simple to give a man that powerful “gut feeling” that tells him you are “the one.”</p><p>It all comes down to understanding attraction: how it works with men, how to create it, and the difference between lasting, burning,
			lifelong attraction, and the kind that flames out faster than it started.</p><p>Because what most women understand as attraction is actually the latter kind. The kind that burns… and fades… very fast.
			And it’s such a painful process that many just want to give up on love altogether.</p><p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. You <strong>can create and experience more attraction and LOVE in your life…</strong>
			regardless of the problems a man might have.</p><p>And I’ll teach you all the secrets in my <em class="strong">Natural and Lasting Attraction Program</em>.</p><p>My <em class="strong">Natural & Lasting Attraction</em> program is designed to give you the skills and understanding to
			create powerful feelings of attraction that go far beyond the physical, making him feel the desire to be around you for all the
			right reasons.</p><p>In it, I focus on the critical skills of building attraction and setting the foundation for more long term attraction from the very start.</p><p>…With an emphasis on the things a man DOESN’T say… but DOES think and feel about dating one woman exclusively and not
			another.</p><p>We’re going to spend some critical time together learning how you can go from one step to the next whether you’ve just met a
			great guy, or you’re dating someone and it’s hanging around in that “casual” phase and you want things to
			progress, grow closer and build a stronger connection that will last.</p><p>You’re going to learn at LEAST 20 different ways to naturally amplify the attraction between you and a man… as well as what
			to talk about, what not to talk about, and what it means if a man is talking about certain key topics on dates and in deeper
			conversations inside a relationship.</p><p>I’m also going to show you how to get a man turned on far more than just “sexually”… to the point where he just
			can’t get you out of his mind, plus <span class="undesrcore">specific</span> ideas and ways to connect with a man to help
			you both take your relationship to the next level… and the next… and the next.</p><p>And that’s just the tip of the iceberg…</p><h2>This Program Is the Fastest Possible Way To Get You Out Of The “Dating Game” And Into Mr. Right’s Arms…</h2><p>You’ll learn:</p><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>The single most powerful way to really “get” to a man</strong> and lodge yourself in his mind so thoughts
				of you keep popping up, and actually interrupt his day! (I secretly love when a woman does this to me, because it lets me
				know she’s something special and I should spend more time with her)</li><li>How to completely avoid the resistance some men have with love and connection that most women struggle to get past, so you can
				bypass this whole unnecessary process of “dating games” and experience love naturally</li><li><strong>How to create intense emotional attraction</strong> that gets a man to choose you over another woman who is younger or
				better looking than you are</li><li>A deadly mistake even confident, experience women make that they think will make a man like them more, but
				<span class="underscore">actually</span> drives a man away because it makes you look “clingy”</li><li>How to <strong>spot and identify an immature man</strong> quickly, so you never again waste your time and heart on someone who
				doesn’t deserve you</li><li>How attraction works for a man, step-by-step (when you know the steps it’s easy and natural for you to evoke powerful
				feelings of love and connection in a man without actively “trying”)</li><li><strong>The real reason why men become “distant”</strong>–I’ll show you how to keep this from happening
				in the first place, and how to easily “fix it” if it has already happened to you</li><li>How to pinpoint and identify the things that are holding you back from having a successful relationship with a man (I’m
				going to get brutally honest here and share some things your friends will never tell you, and men don’t want you to
				know, but it’s about time you did)</li><li>“Chemistry” Explained: How to spark feelings of sexual passion in a man that he cannot ignore, and more importantly,
				<strong>keep the feelings alive</strong> throughout the course of your relationship</li><li>The “instant judgments” men make about women when they first meet them (Here’s how to pass his tests and
				pique his curiosity from the get go)</li><li>A key to intimacy you won’t find in any “relationship” book that <strong>opens a man up for a deeper and
				more fulfilling connection</strong></li></ul><p>I’m not kidding, I really believe this program will change your life.</p><p>Because it is possible (and not too hard) to “re-learn” how to naturally attract a great guy for something more than a
			short fling.</p><p>And it is possible to easily overcome the common types of resistance and roadblocks that men have to committed relationships, even if
			you don’t look like a supermodel (or have her budget or wardrobe).</p><p>The really good news is that if you decide that making love work for you is something you want to learn, and then you take the steps
			towards awareness and learn it, you can get back to being the confident, assured, and naturally feminine and radiant woman who
			draws great guys to you.</p><p>That way, you won’t ever have to worry about ending up thinking that you’ll never have real love in your life… or
			become so completely frustrated and unsatisfied with men and relationships that you resign yourself to the opinion that it’s
			OK to be alone forever.</p><p>Don’t put yourself on the path of a woman who, out of pain and fear, has accepted for herself a loveless life, and a permanently
			disconnected and lonely heart.</p><p>This program will allow you to create and experience more attraction and love in your life… regardless of the problems a man
			might have, and regardless of your past experiences.</p><p>And you can start watching it RIGHT NOW, risk free.</p><div class="banner span-window one-third-height product"><img

		<p>This program will show you how to find the love you’ve been waiting for, and to do it in a way that will make you feel GOOD
			inside, because you’ll know that you’re giving yourself and a man what you both REALLY want–an attractive, happy,
			and “together” woman.</p><p>Creating the right situation, and attracting the right kind of man (or changing the dynamic with the guy you’re already with) for
			a fulfilling long term relationship and lasting love are not out of your reach.</p><p>And it doesn’t have to be difficult–you don’t need to do all the heavy emotional lifting you may have done before.</p><p>In fact, it can–and should be–one of the most enjoyable, fulfilling experiences of your life. I hope you’ll let me show you
			how.</p>
		<p>Your friend in life and love,</p>
