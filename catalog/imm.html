		<p>Think for a moment about where you would be if you had an amazing, mature, great guy in your life. Would you feel more confident if you
			knew:</p><ul class="bullet"><li>Exactly <span class="underscore">what to say and do</span> so that your man feels that staying with you was more than worth
				it, even when you had challenges, fights, and disagreements</li><li>How to keep from feeling unintentionally hurt by little things he says and does… when he may not even know he
				is doing these things</li><li>How to keep your man close to you, and inspire that side of him that wants to be a constant source of love and
				support for you</li></ul><h2 class="center">In Inside The Mind Of A Man program, I’ll show you:</h2><ul class="bullet"><li>One of the most common ways women <strong>accidentally push away good men</strong> they love, and what men need in
				order to feel desperately in love with you</li><li>Insight into what <strong>he’s really saying</strong> – especially when he pushes your buttons or
				frustrates you</li><li><strong>7 specific ways you can communicate</strong> your feelings that will bring you closer together and
				create amazing intimacy… because you won’t come off as “needy” or “too emotional”
				to a man</li><li>Why men <strong>cheat</strong> and specific steps to take to <strong>affair-proof</strong> your
					relationship</li><li>How to know a “good” man when you see one by knowing what <strong>stage of maturity</strong>
				he’s at, just by simple observation</li><li>The <strong>3 Male Archetypes</strong> and why knowing them can help you figure out exactly where your man is at in life,
				what his strengths and weaknesses are, and what a relationship MEANS TO HIM</li><li>And too much more to list here…</li></ul><p>ALSO – for the first time ever – I got an amazing group of 4 open and honest men on stage with me in this program, and
			together we answered the tough questions about men from the female audience. Lots of the women, at the live recording of
			this program, couldn’t stop talking about how hearing these truths from them changed their whole outlook and helped
			them see things in a new way.</p><div class="module span-container pad-left unveil" data-src="https://cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/static/images/banners/w_853_h_550_banner-imm-guysmile.jpg" style="background-image:url('../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/global/static/images/1x1.gif');"><div class="content"><h4 class="strong highlight">If you truly understood how guys think about and feel about women and relationships, then you wouldn’t be still feeling frustrated
