</div>

<div class="section"><div class="container"><p>I’m willing to bet that you’ve met a man, felt an amazing connection with him, become <strong>emotionally and physically
			involved</strong>, and then found out that his feelings for you just weren’t as deep or serious as he led on… or the
			situation told you it was. In fact, you might have seen this happen several times in your experiences with men.</p><p>Meanwhile, you can’t believe that other women around you seem to have it <strong>so much easier</strong>, find great guys, and
			“fall into” those amazing, deep, meaningful relationships that never seem to find you… and last.</p><p>The amazing thing here is that women who DO find these great men and relationships are usually just “regular gals.”
			It’s obviously not just their good looks that makes it easy for them. It’s <strong>something else</strong>.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be great to know <strong>what these women are doing</strong>… and to know exactly what you aren’t doing
			that’s <strong>keeping you from having real love and connection</strong> in your life too? And wouldn’t it be great to
			be able to get inside the heads of a bunch of the women who had already been there and figured it out, and the men they were dating,
			too?</p><p>In the earliest and most famous “personal success” or development book of all time, “Think And Grow
			Rich,” the author, Napoleon Hill, devotes an entire chapter to a key principle that almost every successful and
			fulfilled person uses. It’s called the “Mastermind” principle. In short, if you surround yourself with
			a group of successful people, and learn from them directly, you will tend to improve and <strong>reach success far faster</strong>
			than if you try to do it all on your own.</p>

		<p>And yeah, I’m sure you already talk about men and relationships with your friends. But here’s the thing…
			Lots of them have their own unique situations, and can’t really and truly explain how and why their situation came about.</p><h2>Listen In On Conversations With Dating & Relationship Experts… And Start Transforming Your Love Life Now</h2><p>Over the years, I’ve become friends with a group of women and men who are arguably the best teachers in the world when it comes
			to understanding the amazing and seemingly unpredictable world of men, dating and relationships. I’ve learned so much from
			these people personally that I’ve wanted to figure out how to bring their <strong>secrets and insights</strong> to
			others…</p><p>So I started interviewing each one individually, and I get them to share all their amazing insights and wisdom with me…
			in their own words. And let me tell you, I <strong>get the goods</strong> – the “inside” stuff about men,
			and about women themselves, that isn’t always shared or obvious on the surface which some women spend their entire
			single lives or all of “their never quite good enough” relationships missing out on.</p><p>I’d like you to be part of my amazing community of women who listen to these interviews and are talking about and
			using incredible things that really work to create loving and lasting relationships… and what you’ll learn is
			literally priceless when you think about how it will change the <strong>future of your love life</strong>.</p><p>And NO, I don’t ask questions like “What should a woman wear to turn a guy on more?” or “How can
			a woman make a man happier?”</p><h6>In my Interviews with Experts, I ask specific questions like:</h6><ul class="bullet"><li>How should a woman start a conversation with a man about where things are headed… while keeping the tension,
				chemistry and attraction there?</li><li>Why do men withdraw from women and “emotional intimacy”… and what can a woman do about it so he
				doesn’t pull even further away?</li><li>How can a woman stop doing all the work in a relationship… and get a man to appreciate her more?</li><li>And much, much more…</li></ul><p>In short, I ask good questions. And I get amazing answers.</p><p>One of the most surprising things that I’ve discovered while doing these interviews is that I learn things I’ve
			never heard before. And I’m often talking to experts that I’ve known for YEARS.</p><h2>Here’s How It Works</h2><p>If you were to make an appointment to speak with one of these experts – or even to hear them at a seminar – you’d
			be looking at making a significant investment. But when you subscribe to my <em class="strong">Interviews With Dating & Relationship
			Experts</em>, I’m going to send you access to a new, high-quality, audio interview every month for just
			$19.97 each. And if you subscribe right
			now, you can also download a FREE BONUS interview just for getting started.</p><p>In this bonus interview, you’ll hear me talking with Karinna Kittles-Karsten, known as “The Love Educator.” Karina
			blends Eastern and Western approaches to life, love, and intimacy – she’ll explain how to get in touch with the attractive,
			sensual aspects of yourself so that you <strong>magnetically draw a man to you</strong>. She’ll also offer real, practical advice
			for expanding your capacity to give and receive love… and how to <strong>get more out of a man</strong> in a relationship without
			appearing needy. Plus you’ll discover how to turn up the passion in the very early stages with a man so that he gets excited to be
			with you… and <strong>stay with you</strong>. And you’ll really want to hear her “4 questions” to ask yourself
			before you sleep with a man… We packed all this and more into this one-hour conversation, and it’s yours to listen to whenever
			you want.</p><div class="banner span-window one-third-height product"><img class="u-max-full-width" width="853" height="400" alt="Interviews With Dating & Relationship Experts Program Display" src="../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/global/static/images/banner_transp.png" data-src="https://cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/static/images/banners/w_853_h_400_banner-mi-devices.png" data-src-retina="https://cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/static/images/banners/w_853_h_400_banner-mi-devices@2x.png" /></div><h2 class="center">In Interviews With Dating & Relationship Experts, You’ll Learn:</h2><ul class="bullet"><li>How to <strong>become more attractive</strong> to the kind of man you want</li><li>Ways to create a <strong>solid relationship foundation</strong> from the beginning</li><li>How to increase your chances of <strong>meeting and connecting</strong> with a great guy</li><li>What men are <strong>really looking for</strong> in a woman… and a relationship</li><li>How to determine if a guy has <strong>relationship potential</strong>… before you invest in him</li><li>What a man needs to feel like – <strong>you’re the only one</strong> who can give him what he needs</li><li>And much more…</li></ul><h2>Subscribe To My Monthly Interview Series Completely RISK-FREE</h2><p>I know that you probably want to try before you buy, and that only makes sense.

									that relationships were just too hard for me and I would just be happier alone in life, but now I see
