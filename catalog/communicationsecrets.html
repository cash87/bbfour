		<p>Most women run into one of the following two challenges when trying to communicate with their man:</p><h3>1. He Doesn’t Listen</h3><p>Do you ever feel like what you say to your man goes in one ear and out the other?</p><p>Maybe you’ve asked him nicely to take out the trash every Tuesday for the past 10 weeks… yet every Wednesday morning you
			wake up to find it hasn’t happened…</p><p>Of course, the trash isn’t a big deal. What IS a big deal is that he just isn’t <em>listening</em> and doesn’t seem
			to <em>care</em>.</p><p>And then the same thing happens when you try to share something meaningful… like where your relationship is going or something
			that’s upsetting you… only to find he seems to care more about who won the ballgame or what’s for dinner!</p><p>This can be INSANELY frustrating… and the worst thing is <strong>he doesn’t even seem to care that it makes you feel this
			way.</strong></p><h3>2. He Doesn’t Talk</h3><p>Have you ever known your man was upset about something and asked him what was wrong… and he simply replied with,
			“Nothing” and walked away?</p><p>You KNEW something was going on… but instead of wanting to talk about it and share his feelings… he simply shut
			down… and left you to try and “guess” what was bothering him and how to fix it. It’s hard enough to fix
			the actual problem… but now you’ve also got a passive aggressive problem to deal with on TOP of the actual problem!</p><p>Unfortunately, the things most women do to try to “fix” these frustrating situations gets them nowhere.</p><p>They may try to share LESS of their feelings because they don’t see the point in trying.</p><p>I think you <strong>know</strong> that this isn’t the answer.</p><p>Other women try to overcompensate and communicate MORE.</p><p>But if you’re not communicating with him in a way that is WORKING… it doesn’t matter how much more often you try to
			communicate. If you’re driving and you run into a brick wall, should you keep running into it? After months or even years
			of getting nowhere, most women give up and move on.</p><p>It’s sad. And it sucks. But here’s the good news:</p><p>IT DOESN’T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.</p><p>Really.</p><p>You can <strong>get your man to listen</strong> to you. You can <strong>get him to share his thoughts and feelings</strong> with you.
			And you can get him to take an active interest in making the magical thing you share last and last and last…</p><p>You just need the right TOOLS and techniques to help you do it.</p><div class="module span-container pad-left unveil" data-src="https://cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/static/images/banners/w_853_h_550_banner-cssr-couplegreenshirts.jpg" style="background-image:url('../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/global/static/images/1x1.gif');"><div class="content"><h2>NEWSFLASH: Your Man WANTS To Communicate With You… But He Needs YOUR Help</h2><p>Just because it may seem like your man doesn’t want to communicate on an emotional level… does that
					<span class="underscore">really</span> mean he doesn’t want too?</p><p>In fact, 9 out of 10 <strong>men in a relationship WANT to communicate just as much… if not MORE…</strong> than the woman
					he is with.</p><p>It’s just that nearly every man is taught from a very early age that it is not ok for him to open up to another person.
					It’s just not the “manly” thing to do.</p></div></div><p>These beliefs are POUNDED into his head day in and day out.</p><p>As a result of this upbringing, we men are very cautious when it comes to meaningful communication and the whole idea of
			“feelings” in general.</p><p>It’s not healthy… but it’s all we know.</p><p>So we get a scared and nervous when a woman wants to talk “feelings.” It’s not only something we’ve never
			done … it’s also something that we are taught will make us appear WEAK, INSECURE, and
			<span class="underscore">less</span> of a man.</p><p>This creates a huge dilemma for us…</p><p>We want to open up to you… but at the same time, we just don’t feel comfortable doing so. So we take the “easy”
			way out and just avoid it all together.</p><p>Fortunately, this “bad programming” of ours can actually be GOOD NEWS for you…</p><h2>How The Way You Communicate With Him Determines Whether Or Not You Are “The One” For Him…</h2><p>Most men have so many barriers to open communication that there is a very good chance that your man has <span class="underscore">never
			</span> opened up to a woman before.</p><p>If you can be the one woman who can connect with him on an intimate level, it can be a VERY powerful.</p><p>He will <strong>see you as his soulmate:</strong> the one woman on earth who has helped him release all of those feelings and
			frustrations he’s bottled up inside over all of those years… and the one woman he can TRULY connect with.</p><p>And fortunately. making a man feel comfortable and open to sharing his feelings with you can actually be EASY when you know the right
			way to overcome the barriers to communication that are built up in his mind.</p><h2>How Good Relationships Go <span class="underscore">Bad</span>… <em>And What To Do About It…</em></h2><p>In addition to how men are conditioned, there are all kinds of <span class="underscore">other</span> things that make him resistant to
			communication: stress in other areas of his life, insecurities, or baggage from past relationships.</p><p>In order to effectively communicate with him, it’s important that you learn what his unique barriers to open communication are,
			and how to help him overcome them in a way that makes him excited about doing it.</p><p>When you do this correctly, your man will LISTEN to what you have to say, and open up to you every single day.</p><h2>How To Create The Kind Of Open, Understanding Relationship Most Couples <span class="underscore">Never</span> Get To
			Experience… <em>Quickly And Easily…</em></h2><p>My <em class="strong">Communication Secrets for a Secure Relationship</em> program was designed to teach you how to communicate so
			your man listens, takes interest in what you have to say, and opens up and shares his most intimate thoughts and feelings.</p><p>You’ll learn a complete system for identifying exactly what a man means when he says something… and what it means when he
			doesn’t say anything at all.</p><p>You’ll discover clear ways to communicate and share your thoughts and emotions in a way that a man will listen, respect your
			feelings, and respond in a positive way.</p><p>You’ll also learn about ways of communicating that go BEYOND WORDS, so you can understand what’s going on “beneath
			the surface” and <strong>literally see inside a man’s mind</strong> to figure out what he’s REALLY thinking and
			feeling.</p><p>And that’s just the start. Here are a few more of the powerful secrets you’ll learn:</p><ul class="bullet"><li>How to <strong>keep your conversations from turning into arguments</strong> (Here’s how to see his side from a position
				of <em>understanding</em> instead of anger… and get him to do the same)</li><li>How to react when your man does something WRONG (Most women mess this one up and make things worse… and even cause
				their man to <em>resent them</em>. Here’s exactly how to handle it in a way that makes sure he never makes the same
				mistake twice)</li><li>How to phrase your questions in a way that gets your man to actually give you an <strong>honest answer</strong> instead
				of avoiding them</li><li>EMOTIONAL FREQUENCY – How to tune in to what your man is thinking and feeling so you can <strong>communicate with him at
				a deeper level</strong> than anyone <span class="underscore">ever</span> has before</li><li>Logical vs. Emotional Communication – How to appeal to a man’s LOGICAL side in order to get what <span class="underscore">
				you</span> want <em>emotionally</em></li><li>5 simple things you can do every day to create a deeper connection with your man that <strong>require no “work”
				</strong> (Men LOVE when you do these things… and they often make the difference in whether a relationship lasts for
				<span class="underscore">years</span> or just weeks or months)</li><li>How to move beyond simply “fixing” your relationship… and instead <strong>create a secure foundation</strong>
				that holds the two of you together during good times and bad</li><li>How to identify and <strong><span class="underscore">eliminate</span> any negative communication patterns</strong> you have in
				your relationship and replace them with GOOD HABITS that bring you closer together</li></ul><div class="banner span-window one-third-height product"><img class="u-max-full-width" width="853"

		<p>As you go through this program, you’re going to learn the specific tactics and conversational techniques to create a deep
			emotional bond with your man… and build a trusting foundation for a relationship that <strong>lasts a lifetime</strong>.</p><p>I don’t need to tell you how good it’s going to feel to be able to openly communicate your feelings to your man
			and have him take what you have to say to heart. Your <strong>arguments will now bring you closer together</strong>, rather than
			pushing you further and further apart.</p><p>And, for the first time in your man’s life, he’ll have someone he can trust with his inner-most thoughts and feelings.</p><p>Imagine how good it will feel when your man looks in your eyes and tells you that you are the one woman on earth he can truly connect
			with… the <em>only one</em> that really understands him… and the one he wants to be with <em>forever…</em></p>
		<p>Your friend in life and love,</p>
