		<p>These 15 Moments are the critical points where the “wheels come off” and most men start feeling differently about a
			woman, EVEN IF they were interested or committed before…</p><p>They are:</p><h3>Moment #1: Meeting A Man & Catching His Interest</h3><p>The reality is that there are a lot of attractive, single men out there in the world. But unless you know both WHERE to
			find them, and HOW to get their interest in a way that compels them to ask you out, you’ll just be spinning your
			wheels.</p><p>In my program I show you the secrets to attracting a man from afar, starting conversations and making it EASY for a man
			to ask you out. For this Moment you’ll learn not just the subtle “cues” of courtship and flirting, but
			how to use these effortlessly to catch the attention of the man you want.</p><h3>Moment #2: How To Tell If He’s Interested</h3><p>Whether you know it or not, men don’t talk about their feelings right away when they’re interested. Instead, they
			give subtle SIGNS. If you don’t know how to identify and respond to these signs, it’s very confusing and
			nearly impossible to grow close with a man.</p><h3>Moment #3: Picking the Right Man</h3><p>You don’t want to waste your time on a man who’s not going to treat you well in the long-run. Luckily, there are
			several real-world easy-to-read signs of a man who can go the distance and who won’t disappear on you the moment things
			get interesting.</p><p>You need to know exactly what to look for in a man to figure out if he’s really relationship material or is just
			another disaster waiting to happen.</p><h3>Moment #4: The First Date</h3><p>Most women approach first dates as if they’re all about getting to know a man and seeing if there’s chemistry. The
			truth is that chemistry is the easy part that no one has to work or qualify for. It’s either there, or it isn’t.</p><p>In fact, the whole purpose is to explore if there’s true compatibility between you, dialing up the attraction he feels for you,
			and setting up a loving and truly HONEST connection that’s about knowing the TRUTH about each other instead of pretending
			to be someone you’re not.</p><h3>Moment #5: He Doesn’t Call You Back</h3><p>You had a fantastic date. You laughed, you felt that chemistry and connection, and then he said he’d call and set up another
			date. But days go by and you don’t hear from him. No e-mails, no texts, no calls – nothing. You don’t understand.
			Things were going so well, so why doesn’t he call you?</p><p>There are 3 reasons why a man doesn’t call, and knowing these will show you what’s really going on in a man’s mind
			on the first few dates and how to make sure he is dying to call you.</p><h3>Moment #6: He’s Hot & Cold</h3><p>You’ve seeing a man for a while, but he swings from making plans and spending time with you and wanting to be with you… to
			not calling, acting strange and distant. Most women in this situation accidentally do and say the exact things that push a man
			farther away, turns him off and shuts down the doors of communication on both sides.</p><p>Don’t stay in the dark on what this Moment is really about with a man. Learn what it means when a man is hot and cold, and what
			the exact steps you can take to get rid of this annoying pattern and bring you and the man in your life close and together for good.</p><div class="module span-container pad-left unveil" data-src="https://cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/static/images/banners/w_853_h_550_banner-mmbm-couplekissunderlights.jpg" style="background-image:url('../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/global/static/images/1x1.gif');"><div class="content"><h3>Moment #7: Becoming Exclusive</h3><p>You’ve been dating long enough that you want to be intimate, but are worried about whether or not he’s intimate with OTHER women.
					For a man, nothing is assumed, and unless you’ve had a conversation with him about it, it’s likely he’s not yet exclusive.</p><p>That’s why you need to know how to move with a man into an Exclusive relationship, and do it without the mishaps and confusion that usually
					occur. In fact, there’s a way to do it so a man will value and cherish you even more as a result of the conversation.</p></div></div><h3>Moment #8: Making The Long-Term Commitment Together</h3><p>You’re in love with a man and you hope that it’s “going somewhere.” You’re ready to settle down into a long-term and
			committed relationship. But for some reason, your once loving man grows quiet and distant.</p><p>There is a way to have the commitment talk and share your needs so you and your man both truly commit and move forward in a loving and CONSCIOUS way.
			But this is easier said than done, and I’ll show you how.</p><h3>Moment #9: He Says He’s “Not Ready”</h3><p>You’re feeling great – adored, hopeful and excited. Then BAM, he tells you he’s been thinking, and he’s just NOT READY to move
			the relationship forward. You don’t understand WHY he’s saying this, and you feel extremely frustrated.</p><p>It’s critical to avoid falling into the trap of a half-committed relationship for months or years trying to convince him to feel differently.
			You need to use this as an opportunity to communicate YOUR NEEDS rather than fighting him. Incredibly, this is exactly what pulls a man into
			shape and gets him to recognize the value of what he’s got in you.</p><h3>Moment #10: He Won’t Open Up And Share His Feelings</h3><p>A relationship has no hope if one partner keeps shutting down and stuffing their feelings inside. Men often don’t come with this skill of
			being truly open and bringing their deeper feelings to the surface, but if you’re going to have a lasting relationship that is in any
			way fulfilling for you, then you HAVE TO stop this pattern of your man shutting down.</p><p>It’s easy and no longer your burden to try and fix – once you learn the steps to creating this shift. I’ll show you how.</p><h3>Moment #11: The On-Again, Off-Again Relationship</h3><p>He breaks up with you and you feel completely awful – until he contacts you and says he’s been “thinking” about things and wants to
			talk. You give him another chance, but then days or weeks later, he dumps you AGAIN. What’s going on here? Should you get back with him?</p><p>In this Moment, I’ll reveal the two types of men who do this, what it says about them, and how to prevent your relationship from slipping
			into this painful pattern ever again</p><div class="module color-block span-window seafloor"><h3>Moment #12: You’re Accidentally Pushing Him Away</h3><p>Sometimes when things are going well in relationships, our own feelings get in the way. You’re scared of getting hurt, or making a
				mistake. You worry that he won’t care for your feelings or ultimately be there for you. He senses your fear, your problem being
				vulnerable, your hesitance…and it pushes him away. The more this happens, the worse you feel and the more you find yourself being
				off-center emotionally. You hurt all over again. That’s why you need to learn how to handle these emotions so YOU aren’t the
				one who gets in the way of your relationship</p></div><h3>Moment #13: He’s Spending Less Time With You</h3><p>You thought things were going well, but now he seems to want to spend more time AWAY from you than with you. He calls less and is busier at work and with
			friends.</p><p>There’s a right way to handle this so that you are brought closer together and he feels compelled to make you a top priority. You need to master
			how to do this so you don’t unintentionally scare him away.</p><h3>Moment #14: Share Your Feelings Without Scaring Him Away</h3><p>You have something on your mind that you want to talk to your man about. It’s important, it’s serious, and it’s driving you crazy
			because you’re not sure whether or not you CAN share your feelings without scaring him away.</p><p>There are two critical pieces to this moment: how you share it so you get the best response, and how you use this opportunity to make sure he is
			capable of listening to your true feelings and receiving them in a mature way.</p><h3>Moment #15: How Do I Get Him Back?</h3><p>You can’t get him out of your mind and heart, and you want to know how to get him back. But you aren’t sure what to say or how to win
			his heart all over again.</p><p>There are 5 Requirements you MUST, MUST, MUST follow if you’re even thinking of trying to get your relationship back together with a man.
			Without them, your relationship is guaranteed to fail once again, for most of the same reasons. I can show you how to set things up to
			actually give yourself and your relationship a real chance at change and success this time around.</p><div class="module span-container pad-left unveil" data-src="https://cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/static/images/banners/w_853_h_550_banner-mmbm-coupleheadstouching.jpg" style="background-image:url('../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/global/static/images/1x1.gif');"><div class="content"><h2>Putting It All Together: A Complete Guide Map To Each Critical Moment In Your Relationship</h2><p>Now that you know what these critical Moments are with men, the decision is yours:</p><p>Are you going to give yourself the map to make things EASY?</p><p>Or… are you going to keep struggling and hoping that things just work out on their own, or by finding the perfect

		<p>When you go through this program, you’ll master the 15 make-or-break moments with men and finally have an easy time growing a fun and loving
			relationship that doesn’t crack when tough situations come up.</p><p>Instead, you’ll actually grow closer with the man in your life, and he’ll <strong>fall more deeply in love</strong> with you because of
			the way you’re able to be with him in EVERY moment.</p><p>Too many women lose out on a great guy because they don’t know what to do and say during the common situations that are bound to come up over
			the course of a relationship. When this happens, a woman can feel powerless… as if <strong>finding love with a great guy</strong> just isn’t
			going to happen for her.</p><p>There’s no reason why this should happen to you, and I’m excited to show you how YOU can take control of your love life, starting now.</p>
		<p>Your friend in life and love,</p>
