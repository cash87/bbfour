      <h3>What is the Risk-Free trial period?</h3>
      <p>
        
        
					We offer a 7-day Risk-Free trial on all ebook and audiobook purchases, and a 30-day Risk-Free trial on all 
					other programs and monthly subscriptions
				 
					– so you have time to review your purchase before deciding to keep it.
			</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Here is how it works:</strong> You’ll have a trial period to try out your purchase and decide if you’d like to 
				keep it. If you choose to cancel or return it during your trial period, you’ll receive your money back. The Risk-Free 
				trial is our 100% money back guarantee, and we offer it for your peace of mind, so you can try ANY of the products at NO RISK.</p>
      <p>When placing an order, you’ll see the number of days for your Risk-Free trial displayed on the same page as the buy 
				button, but if you have any questions about the trial for a specific purchase, please feel free 
				to <a href="../contact.html" target="_blank">contact us</a>.</p>

				plenty of time to review your purchase and decide if it is right for you. If you decide NOT to keep it,
