		<h2>A Great Man Is Out There Looking For You… But You Need to Know How To Find Him And Show Him What A Great Catch You Are</h2><p>I’m going to tell you something that may surprise you.</p><p>The problem isn’t a lack of great, available men for you to love. In fact, <strong>great men are everywhere</strong>.</p><p>The problem lies in how you approach meeting them and dating them.</p><p>Ask any single, attractive, HIGH QUALITY man how he is feeling about dating and they’ll give you variations on one of
			two complaints:</p><ol class="strong"><li>“I can’t find a great woman to date”</li><li>“I meet women I am interested in, but then we start dating and she starts saying and doing things that
				completely freak me out, causing me to leave in a hurry”</li></ol><p>What is that about!??!?!?</p><p>How is it possible that great women like you are single, and yet the good available men out there complain that there aren’t
			great women to date?!</p><p>And what does that mean, the she does things to freak him out? How could a woman wanting to give all her love and share herself
			with him freak him out?</p><p>These actions that cause men to freak out can all be traced to one root problem.</p><div class="module color-block span-window light-crush"><h2 class="center">If You Eliminate This Problem, You Will Quickly Find That:</h2><ol><li>The man you feel is a great partner will <strong>see you as the quality woman</strong> he’s been seeking</li><li>The <strong>dating stage will become fun and exciting</strong> for both, and it will pave the way for a loving,
					lasting relationship… instead of blow ups, surprises, arguments, and frustration</li><li>Your man will <strong>look forward to spending time with you</strong>, and thinks about you when you’re not
					around</li><li>You’ll be able <strong>to capture the heart</strong> of a man who is not only “up to your
					standards,” but exactly what you want and who you <span class="underscore">deserve</span></li></ol></div><p>I’m guessing this sounds like a lot more fun than what you might have experienced in the past with a man, right?</p><p>But on the other hand, if you keep on making this mistake of not identifying and addressing this one problem, you will find
			that:</p><ul class="bullet"><li>You’ll keep choosing all the wrong men</li><li>You’ll have an impossible time identifying the right men, even when he’s right in front of you</li><li>A man will quickly lose interest, even after several dates or being intimate with you</li><li>A man will see you as “needy,” even if you’re not</li><li>Your efforts to talk and connect with a man will only turn him off and prevent him from ever wanting a real
				relationship with you</li><li>A man won’t see you as “relationship material” and not want anything more than to casually
				date you</li></ul><p>I think you can see just how dangerous not finding and addressing this problem for yourself really is.</p><p>So now let’s talk about WHAT this problem actually is… and how to eliminate it…</p><h2>The Single WORST Thing You Can Do When Meeting And Getting To Know A Man…</h2><p>After several years now of helping women to better understand and communicate with men, I’ve discovered the <strong>single
			biggest cause of the frustration and disappointment</strong> many women experience in their dating lives.</p><p>I call this mistake the <strong>“Instant Relationship.”</strong></p><p>The “Instant Relationship” is behavior triggered by attraction that has you thinking and acting as though you
			have a relationship with a man <span class="underscore">before</span> you’ve developed one.</p><p>It happens when you meet a great guy and begin an unconscious commitment for mutual honesty and exclusivity between you.</p><p>Of course, this is completely different than CONSCIOUSLY CHOOSING A MAN after getting to know him better… and it
			has 3 very serious consequences:</p><ol><li>The unconscious commitment to a serious relationship made <span class="underscore">too early</span>
				can cause you to overlook flaws, causing you to end up with the WRONG man for you</li><li> Because it is so built up in your mind, you will act and behave differently with this man, likely scaring
				him away by coming on too strong, looking too interested, or coming off as NEEDY or CLINGY</li><li> Because an attractive man who is a great catch is so <span class="underscore">used</span> to this happening with
				the women he dates, it causes him to see you as “just another girl” that he doesn’t mind losing</li></ol><p>In fact, the Instant Relationship can be <strong>as unattractive and gross to a man</strong> as it is for a man you’ve
			just met to <strong>expect to have sex with you…</strong> try and convince you to do so, then act hurt or upset when you
			don’t want to.</p><p>But perhaps worst of all… the Instant Relationship takes away all the fun of getting to know someone and building
			a <strong>strong foundation</strong> for a successful relationship. It puts too much pressure on a man, causing him to withdraw
			from you.</p><p>Unfortunately many, many women make this mistake with men without ever realizing it or consciously knowing it.</p><p>When we meet someone we like, it’s easy for our “biology” to take over and make us do stupid things.</p><p>The good news is that it isn’t all that hard to STOP making this mistake once know you are doing it. I want to show
			you how.</p><h2>Your Roadmap For Meeting And Attracting Mr. Right…</h2><p>Guaranteeing that you end of up in a relationship with the man you want is about <strong><span class="underscore">two things:
			</span></strong></p><p>Stopping the things that don’t work (instant relationships)</p><p>And learning how to find a good man, show him what a great catch you are, and then building a strong foundation that will help your
			relationship together flourish.</p><p>But how do you do this? How do you approach and meet the right man, attract him, draw him close to you, and have him wanting more?</p><p>I’ll answer that, and much more, in my program, <em class="strong">Meeting the One.</em></p><p>If you’re tired of being single and not spending your life with a man who deserves you, then this is the program for you.</p><p>This program goes into great detail highlighting the ways single women unconsciously sabotage relationships at the very start…
			and gives a step by step approach on how to use the dating phase to meet, attract and connect with a high quality man.</p><p>In addition to what YOU should do to connect with a man, this program will show you <strong>how men approach dating differently
			from women</strong>. Understanding his process will enable you to take control of your dating destiny, putting you in control of
			the end result.</p><p>I’ll also cover the fear and anxiety that can come up inside you that gets in your way… and how to deal with the challenges
			and uncertainty that a great guy throws at you just by being who he is.</p><p>Instead of reverting to your old bad habits dealing with men, I’ll teach you how to quickly show him the best of WHO YOU REALLY
			ARE, so he knows exactly how unique and special you are from the moment you meet.</p><p>You’ll also learn how to quickly and clearly identify the WRONG MEN… and keep you from wasting your time and energy on
			someone that isn’t the absolute best match for you.</p><h2>Why Dating Is An Easy Way To Build A Foundation For A <span class="underscore">Lifetime</span> Of Love & Happiness…</h2><p>It’s not uncommon for most women to want to SKIP the dating phase with a man completely and jump right into a committed
			relationship – even if it hasn’t been verbally agreed upon.</p><p>I mean when you know, <em>you know</em>… right?</p><p>Well… not always.</p><p>The problem with skipping the dating phase is that you miss your chance to build a strong foundation for a loving relationship.</p><p>If you’ve ever experienced one of those whirlwind romances where the two of you began spending every waking hour together
			almost immediately after you met, then you probably know that relationships that begin in this manner often burn out just as
			fast as they start.</p><p>It’s kind of like building a house using popsicle sticks and Elmer’s glue rather than wood, screws, and nails.</p><p>Sure, it works for a short time, but it’s bound to fall apart.</p><p>The good news is that <strong>starting things off the right way allows your new romance to grow and last</strong>, while still
			being as exciting, fulfilling, and fun as a whirlwind romance.</p><p>By the time you finish going through the material in this program you’ll know the exact steps to design your perfect
			relationship from the ground up… and have a BLAST doing it.</p><p>And actually… that’s just the start…</p><p>Here are a few more of the exciting things you’ll discover inside:</p><ul class="bullet"><li>The nly 3 reasons why a <strong>man doesn’t call back</strong> (Here’s how to pin-point exactly why a
				man didn’t call… and what to do to practically guarantee he calls next time)</li><li>How many women keep themselves from meeting the man they want without even knowing it (These are things a woman’s
				best friends are often AFRAID to tell her)</li><li>How to get a guy to <strong>want to prove he’s the right guy</strong> for you (This secret shows you what
				he’s all about quickly … so you don’t waste your time on the wrong guy)</li><li>The 10 <strong>limiting beliefs</strong> that prevent women from meeting “the one” (It’s
				important that you learn what they are and eliminate them if you want true love)</li><li>How a <strong>man’s relationship timeline</strong> works – I’ll show you what’s going through his mind
				during all of the different stages… and how long each should last so you don’t make the mistake of rushing
				it or staying too casual</li><li>A creative and ultra-effective way to approach a man you want to meet, then turn things around and <strong>get him pursuing
				you</strong>! (This is the single best way to meet a new man I’ve ever seen because it allows you to approach him
				without looking desperate… and it works nearly every time)</li><li>A big mistake women make with their <strong>body language</strong> that makes a man think you are needy even when you
				aren’t!</li><li>How to know <strong>when to sleep with a man</strong> to ensure that he will keep wanting you so much that he can hardly
				stand it</li><li>How to recognize when a man wants a relationship from you or just wants sex (Here’s how know almost for sure, every
				time)</li></ul><div class="banner span-window one-third-height product"><img class="u-max-full-width" width="853" height="400" alt="Meeting The One Program Display"

		<p>Once you go through this program, you’ll have a very clear understanding of how to meet, attract, and create a fun, magical,
			exciting situation with the right man for you that you can easily grow into the most <strong>open, loving, and honest
			relationship</strong> you’ve ever had.</p><p>I wouldn’t be surprised if the right man for you is within a 10 mile radius of you <strong>right now</strong>. Maybe he is even
			wondering when he’s going to meet a great woman like YOU <em>this very second</em>. Maybe you already know him, but you
			haven’t connected yet.</p><p>Find him. Make it happen.</p><p>Time waits for no one. And it’s time for you to stop dreaming and actually <em>be with</em> the man you want and <strong>live
			the life and relationship you know is possible.</strong></p>
		<p>Your friend in life and love,</p>
