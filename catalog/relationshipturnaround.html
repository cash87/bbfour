Were you taking better care of yourself and feeling sexy, beautiful, joyful, and energized?</p><p>Did your guy surprise you by bringing you small gifts or creating spontaneous moments with you?</p><p>Looking back, does all that seem like a distant memory? If so, I’m betting that a lot of the pain you feel right now is because

		<h2>There Really Is An EASY, Effective Way To Turn Things Around</h2><p>If you’re open to it, and you’re ready… I’m about to tell you about the simple tools I’ve discovered that can
			and will make your relationship work – even if it feels like your relationship is in big trouble right now.</p><p>There’s just one catch though… I need you to get rid of your old belief that it’s going to take a lot of <strong>hard
			work</strong> to try and make your relationship work again. Why? Because until you move past this belief, you’re going to
			<strong>get in your own way</strong> and keep making things harder than they have to be… and keep yourself from a loving, lasting
			relationship.</p><p>I believe that a relationship is in your life to take you to a “higher place” together with your partner… to where you and
			your lover find and bring out the best in each other. It’s in relationships that we grow as people, and find even greater
			expressions of our love. Relationships are there to make our lives better.</p><p>Having said that, has your relationship been making your life better? Or… if you were really honest… has your relationship been
			draining you? Are you feeling like you’re not even seen as the great woman that you already are?</p><p>Well, I’m going to make things really simple for you. You either need:</p><ul class="bullet"><li>a <strong>new relationship,</strong> or</li><li>a <strong>fresh start</strong> in the relationship you’re in</li></ul><p>If you have a man in your life who you love, and you see that a fresh start is exactly what you need… then <strong>now is the
			time</strong> to change things. You can’t afford to wait, or waste more energy thinking about what to do and have the same things
			keep tearing you and your relationship apart.</p><p>I want you to give yourself and your relationship what it needs. I want you to make a fresh start possible for you. And I want you to take
			back the YOU you may have started to lose – or have already lost – in this relationship…</p><h2>The 4 Signs You’ve Lost Yourself In Your Relationship</h2><p>Can you guess the most common realization I hear about from women who have struggled for months or years trying to “fix” or save
			their relationship, and have been unsuccessful at it?</p><p>It’s that while they were busy trying to make their relationship work, they lost themselves.</p><p>What does it mean to get “lost” inside a relationship? And why is it happening to so many women, over and over? Well, for starters,
			getting lost inside of a relationship means that you’ve put aside important parts of <strong>yourself</strong> in order to protect
			or fix a relationship with a man.</p><p>And guess what eventually starts to happen then? You start feeling worn down. You start feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. You start feeling
			run down, overworked, and under-appreciated. And you stop doing the things that fill you up, make you feel great, and that help you bring
			your best self to your relationship:</p><h3>Sign #1: You lose touch with your friends and family</h3><p>Remember how much fun you used to having meeting up with friends for a drink after work, or maybe going to dinner or shopping with your mom,
			your sister or your friends on the weekend? But now you <strong>hardly have any time for this</strong>, let alone time for the things
			you used to enjoy doing just you and your friends and loved ones.</p><h3>Sign #2: You stop paying attention to how you look and feel</h3><p>There was probably a time when you felt really great about how you looked and took a lot of pride in presenting your “best
			self” to the world. But now you’ve stopped exercising, eating well, and taking care of your appearance. You just don’t
			seem to have the time, or energy, to care. And this is largely because, deep down, you don’t feel all that great about yourself
			because of how your relationship is <strong>making you feel</strong>.</p><h3>Sign #3: You feel like your life is passing you by</h3><p>You used to feel so ALIVE and enthusiastic about life! Not these days. These days life feels very… hard, somehow. You’ve
			given so much emotionally to your man or your family that you’re losing the ability to know what YOU want or what YOU feel. And
			you’re <strong>so drained by worrying</strong> about the relationship and giving so much emotionally, that you never get to the
			core of what’s really going on and what you need.</p><h3>Sign #4: You’re making excuses for everything and everyone</h3><p>Maybe your husband has been saying condescending things to you lately, or lashing out in anger, and you excuse it by telling yourself
			that he’s “stressed” or “having a bad day.” Or maybe you know you’re not as fit as you could be, but
			you tell yourself that you “don’t have time… to exercise and eat right. The inability to be radically honest with
			yourself and making excuses is symptomatic of one thing: that you’re not in touch with <strong>who you really are</strong> at
			the core, and what it is you really need in order to feel happy and fulfilled.</p><p>And here’s the worst effect of all: By losing yourself in the relationship, <strong>you’re out of touch with your own
			NATURAL ABILITY to bring your man closer to you.</strong></p><p>In my <em>Relationship Turnaround</em> program, I show you the 6 simple tools to reconnect to <strong>your natural ability as a
			woman</strong> to inspire your man by being the woman he can’t help but want to love and shower with affection.</p><h2>My Relationship Turnaround Program Will Show You How To Bring Back The Romance, Passion, And Devotion… Without The Hard Work</h2><p>If you’ve been, or are currently in a relationship that’s having trouble… then you know how going through fights
			and arguments and painful situation that seem to be repeats of the same problems over and over can drag you down.</p><p>Well, imagine being free of the past and having a new and growing relationship to look forward to… where you and your man both
			learn at each step so you don’t have to repeat your previous mistakes.</p><p>In <em class="strong">Relationship Turnaround</em>, I’m going to show you how simple it really can be to take things from a
			place of uncertainty, distance, and frustration… to a place of understanding, passion, and deep connection. And you…re
			going to learn how to do it all while nurturing yourself and being true to you and your needs.</p><ul class="bullet"><li>The <strong>3 requirements for a great relationship</strong>, and why YOU hold the power to make your relationship better</li><li>9 critical warning signs that you’re <strong>losing yourself</strong> in your relationship, and what to do about it</li><li>A powerful exercise to help you transform the “stories” you’re telling yourself about your life and why some
				of them may be <strong>getting in the way of your happiness</strong></li><li>Why switching your focus can be the secret to improving your relationship completely… an amazing <strong>4-step
				exercise</strong> that will have you “seeing” things in a whole new way</li><li><strong>10 symptoms</strong> that you’re a woman who <strong>does it all</strong>, why it’s dangerous for
				relationship happiness, and how to <span class="underscore">get out</span> of this destructive pattern</li><li>The #1 reason why men will lose passion for you and <strong>stop initiating sex</strong>… and how to drive him crazy
				with desire for you again</li><li>2 simple steps to create <strong>better listening</strong> so that BOTH of you feel acknowledged and respected</li><li>3 effective ways to promote cooperation from a man and <strong>get his support</strong> when you need it</li><li>The 4 rules for a <strong>healthier, more connected relationship</strong>… powerful advice you probably haven’t
				heard told quite this way before</li></ul><p>I’ve also called together a number of <strong>dating and relationship experts</strong> that have shared their very
			best insights about attraction – you’re going to learn how to express your feelings and use communication as a
			healing tool for both of you.</p><p>You’ll realize that a long-term, fulfilling and passionate relationship with a man is not just a “pipe dream,”
			but can actually be a reality for you… starting immediately.</p><div class="banner span-window one-third-height product"><img class="u-max-full-width" width="853" height="400" alt="Relationship

		<p>As you probably know, you can’t change a man. But what you can do is change your relationship.</p><p>And when you change your relationship, guess what happens all on its own? It has the amazing powerful effect of TRANSFORMING
