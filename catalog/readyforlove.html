		<h2>A Man Can’t Fix Your Problem… Only YOU Can</h2><p>When faced with these difficult realizations, what do you do?</p><p>Are you secretly waiting for the RIGHT MAN to show up who will see past the fear, anxiety, and out of control emotions
			and instead love you for who you are?</p><p>That if you could just meet the right man, all of your problems, fears, and disappointments would simply go away?</p><p>I think we’ve all felt this way at one time or another. It’s nice and comforting to think that one day
			we will all meet the love of our lives and live happily ever after. In fact, this fairytale has been burned into
			our minds since we were all very young.</p><p>Only problem is… that’s not going to happen.</p><p>It is <span class="underscore">very dangerous</span> to allow ourselves to believe this fairy tale, because it allows us
			to overlook the real source of the problem.</p><p>Now pay attention, because what I am about to tell you is BIG:</p><p class="strong">Your fear, anxiety, insecurity and out of control emotions won’t be SOLVED by a great man. They are the
			REASON you haven’t found it him yet.</p><p>Many of us hold onto a subconscious belief that someone is going to come along and see us for who we truly are inside,
			recognize our beauty, and accept us wholly for who we are.</p><p>And while this does happen every once in awhile, the reality is if YOU aren’t the one who sees and recognizes it
			YOURSELF first, then the odds of someone else coming along and doing it are very small.</p><p>Just like you probably don’t want to be a “mother” to a man, man also doesn’t want a
			woman who is going to want a “daddy” to take care of her.</p><p>No way.</p><p>A real man… the kind of man you want to be with… is looking for a woman: a lover, a queen, a goddess.</p><p class="strong">Someone to love him and challenge him. Not someone who he has to try and “fix.”</p><p>However, in order to be that mature, attractive, confident woman, you need to learn how to take control of your emotions
			and break through the emotional and psychological barriers that are keeping you from a happy relationship with the
			man of your dreams.</p><p>But dealing with our internal demons is some of the hardest work we can do.</p><p>Our fears and insecurities are deep rooted, and often hidden from our own consciousness. Getting rid of them requires
			help.</p><p>That’s where I come in.</p><h2>Stop Pushing Love Away: Transform Yourself Into Into A Love Magnet</h2><p>I like to think of your own emotional and internal state as a kind of “magnet“ when it comes to your
			relationship.</p><p>When you don’t know what you want, what to do, and know what’s going on inside you… then you
			don’t have a very strong “charge“ to your own internal magnet.</p><p>And you don’t have much ability to pull things towards you without a whole lot of work.</p><p>But when you get yourself in “alignment“ and are in the right internal and emotional state, you start to
			create a very powerful change or force that instantly draws things to you.</p><p><em class="strong">My Ready For Love</em> program is THE GUIDE any woman can use to
			“re-align“ herself so that she’ll pull the right man, the right situations, and the right
			relationship to her.</p><p>You know that feeling when you’re “in the groove“ and things just come to you, one after the other?
			It’s like there’s a powerful force that is bringing happiness and good things into your life and your
			day. But it’s NOT an <em>external force</em> – it’s an internal force that you can magnify to draw
			happiness and love to you EVERY DAY.</p><p>You can very quickly “align“ with this powerful force inside you when it comes to true and lasting
			LOVE… and that’s exactly where my program can help you out.</p><p>Wouldn’t knowing how to find that more balanced place – where emotional fulfillment, love, and joy come
			easier – give you back the confidence and certainty you know you want and need… regardless of what
			challenges come at you in your relationship?</p><p>Would it be nice to no longer be racked with jealousy, fear, insecurity and worry? In addition to learning how to
			permanently banish these feelings from your life, you’ll learn:</p><ul class="bullet"><li>How to quickly identify and <strong>permanently eliminate any self-destructive habits</strong> you may have that
				are spoiling your chances of creating an open, loving relationship with the man you want</li><li>You know that unexplainable feeling you get when you just know a man is right for you? Well guess what…
				MEN get these feelings too. Here’s how to trigger them</li><li>A simple but powerful 6-step exercise that allows you to <strong>get over any past bad situation</strong> or
				experience that’s still bothering you in just 10 minutes… and permanently expel it from your
				mind</li><li>How to say goodbye to “girl“ mentality and start thinking and acting like the kind of mature, whole
				woman that the right man for you is looking for</li><li>How to tap into and bring out the magical center of essence inside of you… giving yourself a
				<strong>powerful aura of CONFIDENCE and WARMTH</strong> that Mr. Right can’t help but notice…</li><li>How to prevent yourself from becoming overwhelmed by the deadly enemies of jealousy, fear and sadness… so
				you can keep a clear mind and always do what’s best for your relationship</li><li>How to avoid the mistake of getting love and affection from the nearest man instead of the right man</li><li>6 things women to do distract themselves from the feeling of loneliness that comes from not being in a loving
				relationship that actually prevent them from ever finding a loving relationship</li><li>7 Deadly mistakes that <strong>turn a man off instantly</strong> and let him know you are not a secure woman
				(you could probably get away with making 1 of these mistakes, but make 2 or more and he will be ready to
				move on instantly…)</li></ul><p>This program wouldn’t be complete without some of the world’s best sharing their personal secrets to help you
			bring the love into your life that you want…</p><p>I was privileged to have four amazing guest speakers join me in <em class="strong">Ready For Love
			</em>, and they’ll share their thoughts, strategies and tactics for eliminating your own personal
			roadblocks and <strong>creating the foundation</strong> for a strong, connected relationship.</p><div class="banner span-window one-third-height product"><img class="u-max-full-width" width="853"
