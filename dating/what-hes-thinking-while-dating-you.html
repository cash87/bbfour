		<p>Frustrating, right?</p><p>You didn’t even get the chance to know or talk about what was going on inside his head.</p><p>How in the world did he think things were supposed to end up working? Were you supposed to read his mind!?</p><p>The problem is that women try to read TOO much into their early interactions with men, which then leads them to think
			that after the first few dates, they’re in what I call the “instant relationship.”</p><blockquote><p>“When a man asks you out for a second or third date, all it means is he’s interested in getting
			to know you better, because he felt a good connection with you on date #1.”</p></blockquote><p>That means women often think they’re in a relationship with a man when he’s still feeling things out and
			probably doesn’t have “relationship” anywhere on his radar. So what IS he thinking on those first
			few dates? Here’s the deal.</p><h2>What Dates 2 and 3 Mean to a Man</h2><p>When a man asks you out for a second or third date, all it means is he’s interested in getting to know you better,
			because he felt a good connection with you on date #1.</p><p>It doesn’t mean that he necessarily wants to be “exclusive” or is thinking “serious relationship.”
			He’s still just getting to know you.</p><p>He’s enjoying your company, having fun, and starting to wonder about you.</p><p>Meanwhile, you’re already thinking ahead to the next few months when this is the ONLY man you’re seeing and things
			are “serious.”</p><p>You’ve already made a decision about this guy, and you don’t even know him that well yet. All you’re
			doing is going by your “gut feeling” and the chemistry you feel when you’re with him.</p><p>So you start acting on that “feeling” and you begin to make certain assumptions about what’s going
			on between you.</p><img class="u-max-full-width u-pull-right" width="265" height="265" alt="Man Smiling At Contemplative Woman" src="../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/global/static/images/1x1.gif" data-src="../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/static/images/stock-images/w_265_h_265_ti_whathesthinkingwhiledatingyou2.jpg" /><p>This can send a really bad “vibe” to a guy, especially when you assume you’re going to be seeing each
			other every weekend, when you express your annoyance with him when he doesn’t call you more often, and when
			you assume a monogamous relationship instead of actually discussing it, then get furious with him when you discover
			he’s still dating other women.</p><p>This is when a guy will pull away, sometimes for good. And you’re left wondering, “What happened?!”</p><p>See what I mean about the dangers of “instant relationship thinking?” I don’t want you to be in that
			situation, which is why I wrote my eBook Catch Him and Keep Him.</p><p>As soon as you download it, you can start reading what guys really think about the whole dating process –
			from what makes them ask you out in the first place, to what keeps them thinking about you and wanting to
			see you again and again, all the way to a REAL COMMITMENT.</p><p>Get your copy here now: <a class="strong" href="../catalog/ebook.html">Catch Him And Keep Him Risk-Free Trial.</a>
			Try it risk-free for 7 days. You’ll learn how to see dating through his mind instead of thinking you’re in
			an instant relationship, which means you can stop yourself from jumping to conclusions and getting hurt.</p>
