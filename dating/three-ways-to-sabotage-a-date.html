		<p>Many women seem to think that just because nothing obvious was bad about a date, that a man should be interested and attracted to her
			and want to go out again… or else something was wrong with him.</p><p>Maybe they think that a few more “okay” dates would cause him to open his eyes and heart and see the light. This is the
			kind of thinking that gets women into a lot of trouble and leaves them wondering why they’re single.</p><p>Here’s what I mean. See if you recognize yourself in any of these scenarios:</p><h2>Problem 1: Playing It Safe</h2><p>Have you ever been so intent on getting a man to like you that you tried to act cool and watched every word you said? This includes
			following his lead all the time, not saying anything about how you think or feel that you think will upset him, and making
			sure that you never say anything that could be too controversial or confrontational.</p><p>Playing it safe like this doesn’t do anything to spark a man’s interest or attention. It makes him lose interest and
			therefore he won’t feel inspired to ask you out again.</p><blockquote><p>“A man falls for a woman who makes him FEEL good and who is exciting and fun to be around – even if she is
			a little ‘bad’.”</p></blockquote><h2>Problem 2: Acting “Formal”</h2><p>This is death when it comes to interest and attraction. A man either feels like he’s on a job interview and doesn’t become
			emotionally engaged with you… or he’s plain bored with you and will have a hard time finding anything personally
			interesting about you.</p><p>A man doesn’t fall for a “good” woman, and he doesn’t want to be with her because she’s polite
			and formal. A man falls for a woman who makes him FEEL good and who is exciting and fun to be around – even if she
			is a little “bad.”</p><h2>Problem 3: Being Boring</h2><p>You are being boring when you talk about boring things. At the top of the list are the things like jobs, family, weather, etc.</p><img class="u-max-full-width u-pull-right" width="265" height="265" alt="Woman On Her Phone During A Date" src="../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/global/static/images/1x1.gif" data-src="../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/static/images/stock-images/w_265_h_265_ti_3waystosabotageadate2.jpg" /><p>These things don’t really help two people get to know one another. Sure, they’re nice… but they
			don’t “cost” much to reveal, as we’d tell any stranger about these things if they asked in a nice
			way.</p><p>More importantly, they don’t create any kind of emotional experience or connection when you talk about them.</p><p>In fact, they put a man back into the space of the mundane aspects of his everyday life… and he’ll bring those
			“mundane” feelings to the table with him when you talk about all these things.</p><p>And guess what happens then?</p><p>He associates these boring mundane everyday feelings with you. And voila… you are another boring date with nothing special or
			interesting going on.</p><p>If you want to know what to say and do on a date to really trigger an intense level of attraction with a man when you meet him, then
			you need to check out my eBook Catch Him And Keep Him.</p><p>I’ve written all about the personality traits and actions that makes a woman stand out in a man’s mind and what will
			inspire him to ask her for a date… again and again.</p><p>Download your copy here now: <a href="../catalog/ebook.html"> Catch Him And Keep Him Risk-Free Trial.</a>
			Try it risk-free for 7 days so you’ll know what to do the next time you’re out on a date to make sure
			you get another one… and another.</p>
