		<p>I’m going to tell you something that’s going to save you a ton of time – especially the hours you spend dissecting a
			man’s behavior.</p><p>When a man doesn’t call once you’ve connected in a deeper way, there are only three possible reasons why:</p><p>1) He doesn’t know what to do with the connection you share because it’s not the right time for him.</p><p>2) He doesn’t know what to do with the connection you share because he’s not mature or capable of getting any closer.</p><p>3) Something was said or done that tells him that a relationship with you is not a fit for him.</p><p>There’s absolutely nothing you can do about the first two reasons. No matter how amazing you are, a man who isn’t ready for
			a relationship won’t suddenly become ready or mature because of anything you do, say, or are.</p><p>But screeching halt at number three, right? Your worst fears are confirmed: something you say or do CAN make a man turn in
			the opposite direction. Well, not exactly. It’s something else…</p><h2>Let Me Tell You About The "Instant Relationships"</h2><p>Many women, after knowing a guy for only a short while, let themselves get wrapped up in what I call an Instant Relationship.</p><p>This is when a woman will already be thinking ahead that she is in a relationship with a guy, that they will be spending all
			their weekends together, and that he won’t be dating any other women.</p><p>This is a problem <strong>when the guy hasn’t talked to her about being in a relationship</strong>. He hasn’t decided
			if she’s someone he wants to commit to, but she’s acting like they’ve already committed.</p><p>And because she thinks they are in a relationship, she gets disappointed when he isn’t exclusive with her or making plans to
			see her on a Friday. <strong>She reacts to that feeling of disappointment in a way that often pressures him and pushes him
			away</strong>.</p><p>He starts withdrawing, and she doesn’t understand why.</p><img class="u-max-full-width u-pull-right" width="265" height="265" alt="Couple Holding Hands and Smiling Across Table" src="../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/global/static/images/1x1.gif" data-src="../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/static/images/stock-images/w_265_h_265_ti_howtopullhimbackifhesdriftingaway.jpg" /><p>When a woman jumps into an Instant Relationship, it’s the fastest way to scare him away.</p><p>So, instead of putting all your energy into creating this Instant Relationship, focus instead on drawing the man you want in and
			connecting with him on an emotional level.</p><p>When you are able to create emotional attraction with a man, you have unlocked the secret to getting him committed to you for
			life.</p><p>I can teach you <strong>how to create this emotional attraction</strong>, and show him you are the kind of women he can’t
			live without.</p><p>In my <a class="strong" href="#signup"><span class="underscore">FREE</span> dating secrets newsletter</a>, I’ll teach you amazing tips
			to put to use in your love life right now, such as the specific personality traits of women who are
			“naturals” at attracting men, and what you have to do in order to embody those traits yourself.</p><p>You’ll also learn how to know when he’s serious about you or if he’s just “playing” you, what to
			say if he’s acting distant or wishy-washy, and how to inspire him to commit.</p><p>I’ll take you inside the mind of a man to show you what he’s REALLY thinking, and why is he is acting the way he is.</p><p>You’ll also learn:</p><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>What goes on inside a man’s mind…</strong> and how attraction works for him</li><li><strong>The seven secrets to communicating with a man</strong> that will create lasting love and affection</li><li><strong>The five things women do</strong> that annoy men and kill intimacy</li><li><strong>The differences in how men and women</strong> think about dating… and why</li><li><strong>The ten fatal mistakes to avoid</strong> that most women make with men</li></ul><p>Don’t waste another day in an “instant” relationship.

			never before.</p>
