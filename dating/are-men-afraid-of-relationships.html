		<p>But then, just a few weeks or months later, that man met another woman. And within just a few weeks with this new woman he was completely
			sprung and head over heels for her… and he was begging HER for a committed relationship.</p><p>Fascinating…</p><p>If you’re like most women, then you’ve seen several men you know do this “instant switch” thing where all of a
			sudden they want a serious relationship, even though all they could talk about before was being “on their own.”</p><p>Here’s the reality: Most men are never “ready” for a relationship… not until they feel the magical feelings and
			experiences with a woman that tell them “Hey, this is the woman for me.”</p><blockquote><p>“For a man, the connection he feels with a woman early on can have nothing to do with whether or not he wants a
			relationship with her.”</p></blockquote><h2>A Man Rarely Consciously Decides To Fall In Love</h2><p>Love – and a lasting relationship – is something that a man discovers when a woman affects him in a deep, intense, emotional way
			to the point where he literally makes a “shift,” and his old conscious and “logical” thoughts of wanting
			to wait are simply overcome with his DESIRE.</p><p>A woman is totally different. When a woman feels that intense physical and emotional connection with a man, she’s often carried
			away by it. And when this happens, something fascinating takes place inside the minds and bodies of most women…</p><p>They start to believe that the connection they feel with a man is in and of itself proof that this is a “special” situation.
			It makes them believe that it’s going to become a deeper relationship and that the man must be sharing these same feelings.</p><img class="u-max-full-width u-pull-right" width="265" height="265" alt="Man Staring Out Window" src="../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/global/static/images/1x1.gif" data-src="../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/static/images/stock-images/w_265_h_265_ti_aremenafraidofrelationships2.jpg" /><h2>Connection Does Not Equal Relationship</h2><p>For a man, the connection he feels with a woman early on can have nothing to do with whether or not he wants a relationship with her.</p><p>He may call her, spend time with her, and even get physically involved with her even though he doesn’t yet want a relationship with
			her.</p><p>What I’m getting at here is that there’s a danger in dating if you don’t understand how men think and behave.
			There’s a danger in that you as the woman expect one thing because of the connection you feel, but the man is completely in
			a different place, emotionally. I call this “The Danger Of A Connection.”</p><p>To learn more about “The Danger of A Connection” and what it can cost you in dating if you don’t understand how it
			works, read my eBook Catch Him And Keep Him.</p><p>I’ll tell you exactly how men really feel about “dating” versus “real relationships” and how to make
			a connection turn into the lasting relationship you really want.</p><p>Go here now to get your copy: <a href="../catalog/ebook.html"> Catch Him And Keep Him Risk-Free Trial.</a>
			Try it risk-free for 7 days, and I know you’ll be blown away by the truth you discover about what really goes on inside a
			guy’s mind.</p>
