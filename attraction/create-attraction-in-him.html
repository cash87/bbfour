		<p>They not only don’t work – they can actually make things worse.</p><p>In this article, I want to help you avoid this painful and frustrating situation in your own future…</p><h2>Avoid The “Weak” Strategies He Won’t Respond To</h2><p>Women develop certain strategies that they think are going to work to get a man’s interest and attention.</p><p>The first strategy is what I call “BRIBERY.”</p><p>It’s when a woman tries to “be nice” by buying a big gift or doing something to show a man how much she
			thinks about him, like helping him solve some personal problem without him asking… or running errands for him.</p><p>If you have a man that you “like” in a romantic way, and he doesn’t “feel it” for you, and you
			do something nice for him, he will not only NOT like you more, but he will most likely distance himself from you.</p><blockquote><p>When you start pursuing him and talking about how you feel, you create negative tension. He’ll get that
			“yikes” feeling and withdraw.</p></blockquote><p>Another weak strategy is what I call “CONVINCING.”</p><p>This is when you tell a man how you really feel about him and how much you want to be with him in hopes that he will “see
			the light” and proclaim his feelings for you too… as if that’s part of the necessary process of getting
			a guy.</p><p>I mean, men know when they are getting “vibes” that a woman is into them. And for the most part, they feel
			it’s harmless and maybe even mildly flattering. But when you start pursuing him and talking about how you feel,
			you create negative tension.</p><p>He’ll get that “yikes” feeling and withdraw.</p><p>And finally, there’s what I call the “FREE SEX” strategy.</p><p>Another name for this is “friends with benefits.” You’re using sex to try to “make” a man feel
			it for you.</p><p>After all, the more you’re with him that way, the deeper your feelings get for him. So why shouldn’t it work the
			same way for HIM, right?</p><p>Wrong.</p><h2>Don’t Confuse Chemistry With Real Connection</h2><p>The reality is that men can often be physically intimate with a woman and not even be THINKING “relationship” at
			all. To him, it’s just sex, it’s fun and feels nice, and if he’s NOT feeling real emotional attraction
			for you, he’ll disappear as soon as you start asking for anything deeper or “real.”</p><p>None of these three strategies work because they’re coming from a position of FEAR and WEAKNESS, and what’s worse,
			they are saying something about you that you never intended. I hate to say it, but they communicate that you’re
			desperate or needy, even if you never considered yourself that way.</p><img class="u-max-full-width u-pull-right" width="265" height="265" alt="Man Holding Woman And Kissing Her" src="../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/global/static/images/1x1.gif" data-src="../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/static/images/stock-images/w_265_h_265_ti_dothistocreateintenseattractioninhim.jpg" /><p>On the other hand, there are certain “mindsets” that women who are naturally successful in love have that draw
			men’s attention and interest.</p><p>These beliefs or “mindsets” trigger a very powerful response in a man. It tells him that this is a woman who is
			self-assured and knows what she wants and how to get it. They also communicate that the woman is “higher
			status” and thus naturally compel a man to think she’s unique and someone worth his time and attention.</p><p>In other words, these are the “attitudes” a woman projects that can make her irresistible to a man.</p><p>If your “love strategy” hasn’t been too successful lately, it’s time to stop feeling bad about yourself.
			It’s time to finally do what I know works to attract and keep a man.</p><p>In my eBook Catch Him and Keep Him, I teach you how to develop and amplify certain qualities you already have that will drive
			him to you… and only you.</p><p>You’ll learn the specific tips, behaviors and strategies for building and keeping a deep and intense level of attraction
			with a man, such as the personality traits that attract men, body language, and much more.</p><p>Go here now to get your copy and preview it RISK-FREE for 7 days: <a href="../catalog/ebook.html">Catch Him And Keep
			Him Risk-Free Trial</a>.</p>
