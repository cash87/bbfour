		<p>Right from the early stages of dating, there are ways to tip the balance so that your general experience together is positive.
			Here’s how.</p><h2>Having Control Over Your Emotions</h2><p>Your emotions and how you communicate them have tremendous power. They have the power to instantly reconnect you and a man, and
			they have the power to push him away in no time flat.</p><p>If you want to have a conscious relationship and you want to enjoy the incredible feeling that comes from being able to stay close
			and connected with the man in your life – even during the tough times or bumps in the road – then you must learn how to “own” your
			emotions in situations with men, and communicate them in a way that uses their power to benefit you and your relationship… not break
			it apart.</p><p>When you don’t take the time to process emotions and put them into perspective, then the feelings you share have a very different
			effect on your man than you’d like. I’m talking about what happens when you lose your center and let your fears and emotions take
			over about something that simply isn’t going to be a big deal to you two hours later. So, take some time to let your emotions settle
			BEFORE you express them to a man. If the issue is still bothering you, you’ll get far better results by expressing it in a calm
			manner… and he’ll perceive your overall experience as a positive one.</p><h2>Imagining The Best Possible Outcome</h2><p>Most of us (men and women) use our minds to imagine the worst possible outcomes for dating and relationship situations.</p><p>Think about those situations when a man doesn’t call you back when you think he should. If you immediately start to wonder where
			he is, what he’s doing, and who he’s with, you create negative emotions. You make up pictures in your mind of him out with other women,
			doing fun things without you, etc., and it’s really upsetting. This inevitably creates negative tension and distance between the two of
			you.</p><img class="u-max-full-width u-pull-right" width="265" height="265" alt="Man And Woman Kissing On Beach" src="../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/global/static/images/1x1.gif" data-src="../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/static/images/stock-images/w_265_h_265_ti_gethimaddictedtoyouforever.jpg" /><p>Instead, start doing yourself a favor:</p><p>1) Visualize your ideal outcome</p><p>2) Make positive meaning out of the experience for yourself</p><p>If he doesn’t call you back right away, imagine that he is freaked out with his own life and schedule (maybe his boss just
			threatened to let him go), and make it mean that when he finally does talk to you, he’s going to be even more interested because
			it took you so long to catch up with each other.</p><p>If he tells you he’s not ready for a relationship right now because of his past, you can freak out and put more distance
			between the two of you. Or you can choose to look at it this way: that he really likes you and has had to think about being
			in a relationship because his feelings are so strong. When you spin things positively, something incredible happens: you
			will feel a levity that is far from the pain you’d normally feel in a situation like this, and in turn this makes you much
			more attractive – if not to him, then to a man who will really be able to commit to you.</p><p><strong>When you continuously strive to adopt a positive mindset</strong> and create fun, positive experiences in a relationship, then the
			man will start to see you as a positive aspect of his life… and pretty soon he’ll see you as a necessary part of his life,
			too. Here’s the thing: a man doesn’t usually walk around thinking, “Gee, I really want to be in a committed relationship
			with one woman for the rest of my life.” What happens is this: he meets the woman who makes him feel so good, he can’t
			imagine his life without her.</p><p>If you want to know how to share your feelings with a man – even the difficult ones – in a way that will really make him
			want to listen and will make him feel even deeper attraction for you, subscribe to <a class="strong" href="#signup">my free
			e-newsletter</a>. You’ll learn how to make the most of the ultimate training ground for achieving this attractive positive
