		<p>Have you ever tried to understand why a man will fall hard for a certain woman, even though she might not seem like the
			best match for him?</p><p>The truth is that a man is attracted to one woman and not another largely because of the way that one woman makes him FEEL.
			And not for any other reason. You see, attraction and connection have their own logic. In fact, they DEFY logic. Let me explain…</p><h2>The Reasons He Won't Fall In Love</h2><p>A man doesn’t decide to be with a woman because he values a relationship and having true love in his life. Or because she’s
			so good to him and does so many loving things for him that he recognizes the LOGICAL value of staying with her and makes the
			“right” decision.</p><p>Feelings and emotions have their own logic, which has nothing to do with what makes “sense” or what is “fair.” And the sooner
			you accept this as true about men, the easier everything in your love life and relationship will become…</p><h2>Emotional Attraction: Why He'll Choose You</h2><p>The emotional experiences that a man has when he's around a woman are the single most powerful reasons why he either wants a
			long-term relationship, or doesn't.</p><p>In other words, what a man feels as a result of the experiences he has with you are what can make him see you as a woman he
			absolutely needs to get closer to.</p><p>So, what exactly makes a man develop this kind of “emotional attraction” for you? And by emotional attraction, I mean a feeling
			that goes beyond physical attraction – the kind of attraction that grows over the long term.</p><h2>The Allure Of The Woman In Control… Of Herself</h2><img class="u-max-full-width u-pull-right" width="265" height="265" alt="Man Gazing Over Womans Shoulder" src="../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/global/static/images/1x1.gif" data-src="../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/static/images/stock-images/w_265_h_265_ti_gethimaddictedtoyouforever2.jpg" /><p>A woman who can communicate to a man on a deeper level that she's aware and in control of her own experience and “emotional”
			state will make a man feel intense attraction for her on that same emotional level. She's an “emotionally attractive” woman,
			which can tell a man all kinds of things about her beyond the physical attraction and interest he might have.</p><p>This woman doesn’t let her day-to-day feelings depend on what a man does or doesn’t do. If plans change, she’s either
			content to go with the flow, or she’ll clearly let him know the new plan isn’t right for her. Most of all, she’s able to
			communicate her feelings in a calm manner, and she does so BEFORE issues fester. This sends a strong message: she’s in
			control of her happiness.</p><p>When a man experiences that you’re not making him responsible for your happiness, it immediately takes an enormous amount
			of pressure off him. Suddenly, he can relax because he realizes you’re with him because you want to be – not because you NEED
			to be. And that’s one of the most attractive qualities of all.</p><p>Understanding attraction and how it works in a man is crucial for having a lasting, secure relationship.</p><p>I'll tell you what makes a guy want to commit to you, and what you can do to get him there without any convincing or game playing.</p><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>What goes on inside a man's mind…</strong> and how attraction works for him</li><li><strong>The seven secrets to communicating with a man</strong> that will create lasting love and affection</li><li><strong>The five things women do</strong> that annoy men and kill intimacy</li><li><strong>The differences in how men and women</strong> think about dating… and why</li><li><strong>The ten fatal mistakes to avoid</strong> that most women make with men</li></ul>
