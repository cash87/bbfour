		<h2>Attraction Killer #1: Bribery</h2><p>Have you ever bought a man a big gift or run his errands without his asking?  You think you are “being
			nice”, but what he sees is that you are trying to buy his affection.</p><p>For a man to want to be with you, <strong>he needs to see being with you as the ultimate prize, and not all the
			nice gifts and actions that come with it.</strong></p><p>I don’t mean that it isn’t a good thing to show your love and thoughtfulness, but if a guy hasn’t fully
			committed to you yet, he’ll interpret your kindness as you trying to bribe him into falling in love.</p><p>A man falls in a love with who a woman is and how she makes him feel, not what she will do for him. He
			may like all the attention and gifts, and he might even keep you around while it’s convenient. But he won’t
			see you as the woman he can spend the rest of his life with.</p><h2>Attraction Killer #2: Convincing</h2><p>You think that sharing your feelings and desire to be with him will help him open up and feel connected
			to you. But what he hears is you trying to convince him to commit to you.</p><p><strong>A man values things he has to work hard to earn.</strong> When you share your feelings and “pursue” his love, he
			won’t see you as a prize he has to work to win. He’ll take you for granted, or grow disinterested, and start
			being drawn to less available women.</p><p>He hears the feelings that you share in order to grow closer, and he instinctively moves farther away.</p><h2>Attraction Killer #3: Free Sex</h2><p>This is the most frequent and most dangerous of the attraction-killers. So many women mistake sex for
			intimacy, and so they use it to try to “make” a man feel connected.</p><p>After all, the more you’re physically intimate, the deeper your feelings get for him. So why shouldn’t it
			work the same way for HIM, right?</p><p>Wrong.</p><p><strong>The reality is that men can often be physically intimate with a woman and not even be THINKING “relationship”
			at all.</strong> To him, it’s just sex. It’s fun and feels nice, and he’ll disappear as soon as you
			start asking for anything deeper or “real.”</p><img class="u-max-full-width u-pull-right" width="265" height="265" alt="Man Standing Away Woman" src="../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/global/static/images/1x1.gif" data-src="../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/static/images/stock-images/w_265_h_265_ti_communicationmistakesyoucouldbemaking2.jpg" /><h2>You Don’t Need To “Prove” Anything</h2><p>None of these strategies work because they communicate to a man that you are desperate or needy, even
			when it’s not actually true. Instead of trying to prove to him that he should love you, you have to show
			him that he’ll need to prove to YOU that he’s worthy of your love.</p><p>You are a prize that he’d be lucky to have.  And the sooner you start seeing yourself that way, and
			showing him that’s how you see yourself, the sooner you’ll have him eating out of your hand.</p><p>So stop bribing, and convincing and sleeping your way to his affection. <strong>Instead, learn how to demonstrate
			to a man that you are a prize that he is desperate to win.</strong></p><p>And the best place to learn how to do that is in <a href="#signup"><strong>my free dating advice newsletter</strong></a>. It will
			teach you everything you need to know about the inner workings of a male mind, from dating all the way to lasting
			commitment.</p><p>In my FREE newsletters, you’ll learn:</p><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>What goes on inside a man’s mind…</strong> and how attraction works for him</li><li><strong>The seven secrets to communicating with a man</strong> that will create lasting love and affection</li><li><strong>The five things women do</strong> that annoy men and kill intimacy</li><li><strong>The differences in how men and women</strong> think about dating… and why</li><li><strong>The truth about men who aren’t “emotionally available”…</strong> and what to do if
				you are dating one</li></ul><p>It’s completely free, and it will change the way you relate to men forever:</p>
