		<p>Did you know that most men decide if a woman is “girlfriend material” within a few seconds of meeting her?</p><p>That’s right – if you don’t know how to create the right first impression with a man, then you just might
			get thrown into the “just a friend” category FOR GOOD. That’s why it’s important to understand what causes a
			man to be attracted to you at a deeper level from the get-go.</p><h2>Why a Man Recognizes One Woman as Relationship Material and Another as Just a “Fling”</h2><p>Men think of women as relationship material – or a “cool girl” – when they see that a woman understands
			something that other women can’t even see going on.</p><p>“Cool girls” exude positive emotional energy that men can relate to. And they’re “naturally” the kind of
			women who every man is inexplicably drawn to.</p><p>Here’s a list of what “cool girls” DON’T DO:</p><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>Cool Girls DON’T</strong> exaggerate about what’s going on around them or what a man’s doing,
				unless they’re doing it as a joke or to make fun of a man in a playful way</li><li><strong>Cool Girls DON’T</strong> say everything that they’re feeling and experiencing. They think
				before they speak</li><li><strong>Cool Girls DON’T</strong> mention bad situations, issues or problems from the past unless
				it’s a total “must” or extremely important and they haven’t been able to talk about
				it yet. They find the right time for them AND their man to talk. Otherwise, Cool Girls live in the present moment</li><li><strong>Cool Girls DON’T</strong> try to FORCE a man to talk about his feelings. They know that it
				will only backfire and he’ll think she’s being needy and he’ll close off</li></ul><p>In fact, it’s typical for most men to react with withdrawal or frustration to a woman who demonstrates these types of behavior.</p><h2>What Makes a Woman a “Cool Girl” in a Man’s Mind</h2><img class="u-max-full-width u-pull-right" width="265" height="265" alt="Man and Woman Toasting" src="../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/global/static/images/1x1.gif" data-src="../../cdn-www.catchhimandkeephim.com/cms/static/images/stock-images/w_265_h_265_ti_areyouaflingtohimorsomethingmore.jpg" /><p>So, let’s keep talking about some of the important personality traits when it comes to creating ATTRACTION with a man and growing
			towards something deeper.</p><p>Here’s a few of the “cool girl” Dos:</p><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>Cool girls choose not to complain or talk</strong> about things for too long that are
				not other people’s responsibility or impossible for anyone to solve given the current situation</li><li><strong>Cool girls bring funny, positive thoughts and feelings</strong> to situations to create an
				experience that men will want to have again and again</li><li><strong>Cool girls are willing to go with the flow</strong> when it comes to social things but make
				assertions when they have opinions and ideas</li><li><strong>Cool girls have options and things to do</strong> that keep them satisfied so they don’t feel like
				they’re left out if they’re not invited to something (And even if they do, they certainly don’t complain
				about it or even mention it – they FIND something to do that makes them happy.)</li><li><strong>Cool girls prefer that a man makes up his own mind;</strong> they don’t try to make a man do
				something</li><li><strong>Cool girls DO know that the way they feel and talk about themselves</strong> is how men will feel
				about them</li></ul><p>So, are YOU a “cool girl?”</p><p>Are you the kind of woman that men are “naturally” drawn to and want to be with… for more than just a fling?</p><p>And do you get how to say all the right things verbally and non-verbally to let him know that you’re the kind of girl he’d
			like to connect with and fall in love with?</p><p>And the best place to learn how to do that is in <a class="strong" href="#signup">my free dating advice newsletter</a>. It will
			teach you everything you need to know about the inner workings of a male mind, from dating all the way to lasting
			commitment.</p><p>It’s completely free, and it will change the way you relate to men forever:</p>
